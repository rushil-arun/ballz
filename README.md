# ballz
A playable replica of Ballz and an AI version. All rights go to whoever made ballz.
The normal game uses pygame and involves two powerups. The rest of the game is identical to ballz, which can be found on the App Store.
The AI uses an algorithm that simulates different possible moves and picks the best ones. Feel free to implement it using a neural network.
